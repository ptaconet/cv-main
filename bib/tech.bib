Data on the magnitude and composition of landings, discards, and sh- ing eort are currently managed at basin scale by the Secretariats of the tRFMOs. Consequently, data formats and reference codes have evolved rather independently despite some links with the FAO Coordinating Work- ing Party on Fishery Statistics. We have developed a global harmonized database for tuna sheries data by collating the public domain datasets (total catch, monthly-spatially aggregated catch and eort, and catch at size) from IOTC, ICCAT, IATTC and WCPFC. The database currently covers the period 1919-2014 and is freely accessible online along with a set of open source codes to handle the data, i.e. transform the data formats, load the standardized data into the database, extract data and compute a suite of indicators (e.g. global maps of catch). The database along with the codes represent the "toolbox".In a previous note ([Taconet et al.]), we have described the general method- ological approach used for the collation and formatting of the data, as well as the bene ts of using standardized data formats and code lists for scien- ti c research and sheries management. In this note, we present the codes available in the toolbox, the services that they oer and how users can access them through various applications. We argue that these methods are likely to bring visibility to the tuna RFMOs public domain datasets, as well as to facilitate their use. Overall, we showcase how the variety of available services and applications enables to reach dierent communities of users that might be interested in accessing tuna fisheries data for various uses and purposes.},

	abstract = {Assessing the status of tuna and tuna-like populations for providing management advice requires the analysis of multiple data sets collected by the contracting parties and cooperating non-contracting parties of Tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (tRFMOs) Conventions. Data on the magnitude and composition of landings, discards, and fishing effort are currently managed at basin scale by the Secretariats of the tRFMOs. Consequently, data formats and reference codes have evolved rather independently despite some links with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics. In a paper presented in 2016 at the IOTC WPDSC12 (WPDCS12-27), we had introduced the global harmonized database for tuna fisheries that we have developed by collating the public domain datasets (total catch, monthly-spatially aggregated catch and effort) from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), the Western-Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT). We had as well introduced the set of open source codes (the "toolbox") to handle the data, i.e. transform the data formats, load the standardized data into the database, and compute a suite of indicators. However, the project - both the data and the toolbox - was still at an early stage of development. Details on the benefits of this global database for fisheries science and management, as well as technical details on the database, were also exposed in previous papers (ICCAT SCRS/2016/202). In this paper, we expose the progresses that we have made in 2017. We first present the diversity of data that are available in the open database, and we then focus on the tools that we have developed to access and exploit efficiently the data.},

Our objective is to propose services to format and exchange tuna fisheries data and indicators, and promote standards for metadata and data formats to facilitate their through web-based tools. Among others, the expected benefits of the project are the promotion of communication towards tRFMOs and their member States as well as to the general public and the increase of transparency and accessibility to fisheries data sets, indicators, underlying codes, and related expertise.},
