	abstract = {Insecticide resistance and behavioral adaptation of malaria mosquitoes impact the efficacy of long-lasting insecticide nets - currently the main malaria vector control tool. To develop and deploy complementary, efficient and cost-effective control interventions, a good understanding of the drivers of these physiological and behavioural traits is needed. In this data-mining work, we modeled a set of indicators of physiological resistances to insecticide (prevalence of three target-site mutations) and biting behaviours (early- and late-biting, exophagy) of anopheles mosquitoes in two rural areas of West-Africa, located in Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire. To this aim, we used mosquito field collections along with heterogeneous, multisource and multi-scale environmental data. The objectives were i) to assess the small-scale spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the indicators, ii) to better understand their drivers, and iii) to assess their spatio-temporal predictability, at scales that are consistent with operational action. The explanatory variables covered a wide range of potential environmental determinants of vector resistance to insecticide or feeding behaviour : vector control, human availability and nocturnal behaviour, macro and micro-climatic conditions, landscape, etc. The resulting models revealed many statistically significant associations, although their predictive powers were overall weak. We interpreted and discussed these associations in light of several topics of interest, such as : respective contribution of public health and agriculture in the development of physiological resistances, biological costs associated with physiological resistances, biological mechanisms underlying biting behavior, and impact of micro-climatic conditions on the time or place of biting. To our knowledge, our work is the first studying insecticide resistance and feeding behaviour of malaria vectors at such fine spatial scale with such a large dataset of both mosquito and environmental data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
